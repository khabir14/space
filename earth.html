            Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. While large
            amounts of water can be found throughout the Solar System, only Earth sustains liquid surface water. About
            71%
            of Earth's surface is made up of the ocean, dwarfing Earth's polar ice, lakes, and rivers. The remaining 29%
            of
            Earth's surface is land, consisting of continents and islands. Earth's surface layer is formed of several
            slowly
            moving tectonic plates, interacting to produce mountain ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes. Earth's liquid
            outer
            core generates the magnetic field that shapes Earth's magnetosphere, deflecting destructive solar winds.
            <br><br>
            Earth's atmosphere consists mostly of nitrogen and oxygen. More solar energy is received by tropical regions
            than polar regions and is redistributed by atmospheric and ocean circulation. Water vapor is widely present
            in
            the atmosphere and forms clouds that cover most of the planet. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere like
            carbon
            dioxide (CO2) trap a part of the energy from the Sun close to the surface. A region's climate is governed by
            latitude, but also by elevation and proximity to moderating oceans. Severe weather, such as tropical
            cyclones,
            thunderstorms, and heatwaves, occurs in most areas and greatly impacts life.
            <br><br>

            Earth is an ellipsoid with a circumference of about 40,000 km. It is the densest planet in the Solar System.
            Of
            the four rocky planets, it is the largest and most massive. Earth is about eight light minutes away from the
            Sun
            and orbits it, taking a year (about 365.25 days) to complete one revolution. Earth rotates around its own
            axis
            in a day. Earth's axis of rotation is tilted with respect to its orbital plane with the Sun, producing
            seasons.
            Earth is orbited by one permanent natural satellite, the Moon, which orbits Earth at 380,000 km (1.3 light
            seconds) and is roughly a quarter as wide as Earth. The Moon always faces the Earth with the same side
            through
            tidal locking and causes tides, stabilizes Earth's axis, and gradually slows its rotation.
            <br><br>
            Earth formed over 4.5 billion years ago. During the first billion years of Earth's history, the ocean formed
            and
            then life developed within it. Life spread globally and began to affect Earth's atmosphere and surface,
            leading
            to Earth's Great Oxidation Event two billion years ago. Humans emerged 300,000 years ago, and have reached a
            population of almost 8 billion today. Humans depend on Earth's biosphere and natural resources for their
            survival, but have increasingly impacted Earth's environment. Today, humanity's impact on Earth's climate,
            soils, waters, and ecosystems is unsustainable, threatening people's lives and causing widespread extinction
            of
            other life.

            <b>Etymology</b><br>
            <hr><br><br>
            The modern English word Earth developed, via Middle English, from an Old English noun most often spelled
            eor√∞e. It has cognates in every Germanic language, and their ancestral root has been reconstructed as *er√æ≈ç.
            In its earliest attestation, the word eor√∞e was already being used to translate the many senses of Latin
            terra
            and Greek Œ≥·øÜ gƒì: the ground, its soil, dry land, the human world, the surface of the world (including the
            sea),
            and the globe itself. As with Roman Terra/Tell≈´s and Greek Gaia, Earth may have been a personified goddess
            in
            Germanic paganism: late Norse mythology included J√∂r√∞ ('Earth'), a giantess often given as the mother of
            Thor.
            <br><br>

            Historically, earth has been written in lowercase. From early Middle English, its definite sense as "the
            globe"
            was expressed as the earth. By Early Modern English, many nouns were capitalized, and the earth was also
            written
            the Earth, particularly when referenced along with other heavenly bodies. More recently, the name is
            sometimes
            simply given as Earth, by analogy with the names of the other planets, though earth and forms with the
            remain
            common. House styles now vary: Oxford spelling recognizes the lowercase form as the most common, with the
            capitalized form an acceptable variant. Another convention capitalizes "Earth" when appearing as a name (for
            example, "Earth's atmosphere") but writes it in lowercase when preceded by the (for example, "the atmosphere
            of
            the earth"). It almost always appears in lowercase in colloquial expressions such as "what on earth are you
            doing?" <br><br>

            Occasionally, the name Terra /Ààt…õr…ô/ is used in scientific writing and especially in science fiction to
            distinguish humanity's inhabited planet from others, while in poetry Tellus /Ààt…õl…ôs/ has been used to denote
            personification of the Earth. Terra is also the name of the planet in some Romance languages (languages that
            evolved from Latin) like Italian and Portuguese, while in other Romance languages the word gave rise to
            names
            with slightly altered spellings (like the Spanish Tierra and the French Terre). The Latinate form G√¶a or
            Gaea
            (English: /Ààd íiÀê…ô/) of the Greek poetic name Gaia (ŒìŒ±·øñŒ±; Ancient Greek: […°√¢iÃØ.a] or […°√¢j.ja]) is rare,
            though
            the alternative spelling Gaia has become common due to the Gaia hypothesis, in which case its pronunciation
            is
            /Àà…°a…™…ô/ rather than the more classical English /Àà…°e…™…ô/. <br><br>

            There are a number of adjectives for the planet Earth. From Earth itself comes earthly. From the Latin Terra
            comes terran /Ààt…õr…ôn/, terrestrial /t…ôÀàr…õstri…ôl/, and (via French) terrene /t…ôÀàriÀên/, and from the
            Latin Tellus comes tellurian /t…õÀàl ä…ôri…ôn/ and telluric. <br><br>

            <h2 id="basic">Basic planetary data</h2>
            <hr><br><br>
            The mean distance of Earth from the Sun is about 149,600,000 km (92,960,000 miles). The planet orbits the
            Sun in a path that is presently more nearly a circle (less eccentric) than are the orbits of all but two of
            the other planets, Venus and Neptune. Earth makes one revolution, or one complete orbit of the Sun, in about
            365.25 days. The direction of revolution‚Äîcounterclockwise as viewed down from the north‚Äîis in the same
            sense, or direction, as the rotation of the Sun; Earth‚Äôs spin, or rotation about its axis, is also in the
            same sense, which is called direct or prograde. The rotation period, or length of a sidereal day (see day;
            sidereal time)‚Äî23 hours, 56 minutes, and 4 seconds‚Äîis similar to that of Mars. Jupiter and most asteroids
            have days less than half as long, while Mercury and Venus have days more nearly comparable to their orbital
            periods. The 23.44¬∞ tilt, or inclination, of Earth‚Äôs axis to its orbital plane, also typical, results in
            greater heating and more hours of daylight in one hemisphere or the other over the course of a year and so
            is responsible for the cyclic change of seasons. <br><br>
            With an equatorial radius of 6,378 km (3,963 miles), Earth is the largest of the four inner, terrestrial
            (rocky) planets, but it is considerably smaller than the gas giants of the outer solar system. Earth has a
            single natural satellite, the Moon, which orbits the planet at a mean distance of about 384,400 km (238,900
            miles). The Moon is one of the bigger natural satellites in the solar system; only the giant planets have
            moons comparable or larger in size. Some planetary astronomers consider the Earth-Moon system a double
            planet, with some similarity in that regard to the dwarf planet Pluto and its largest moon, Charon.
            <br><br>
            Earth‚Äôs gravitational field (see gravitation) is manifested as the attractive force acting on a free body at
            rest, causing it to accelerate in the general direction of the centre of the planet. Departures from the
            spherical shape and the effect of Earth‚Äôs rotation cause gravity to vary with latitude over the terrestrial
            surface. The average gravitational acceleration at sea level is about 980 cm/sec2 (32.2 feet/sec2).
            <br><br>
            Earth‚Äôs gravity keeps the Moon in its orbit around the planet and also generates tides in the solid body of
            the Moon. Such deformations are manifested in the form of slight bulges at the lunar surface, detectable
            only by sensitive instruments. In turn, the Moon‚Äôs mass‚Äîrelatively large for a natural satellite‚Äîexerts a
            gravitational force that causes tides on Earth. The Sun, much more distant but vastly more massive, also
            raises tides on Earth. (See celestial mechanics: Tidal evolution.) The tides are most apparent as the
            twice-daily and daily rises and falls of the ocean water, although tidal deformations occur in the solid
            Earth and in the atmosphere as well (see tide). The movement of the water throughout the ocean basins as a
            result of the tides (as well as, to a lesser extent, the tidal distortion of the solid Earth) dissipates
            orbital kinetic energy as heat, producing a gradual slowing of Earth‚Äôs rotation and a spiraling outward of
            the Moon‚Äôs orbit. Currently this slowing lengthens the day by a few thousandths of a second per century, but
            the rate of slowing varies with time as plate tectonics and sea-level changes alter the areas covered by
            inland bays and shallow seas. (For additional orbital and physical data, see the table.)

            <hr><br><br>
            The blankets of volatile gases and liquids near and above the surface of Earth are, along with solar energy,
            of prime importance to the sustenance of life on Earth. They are distributed and recycled throughout the
            atmosphere and hydrosphere of the planet.
            <br><br>
            <h3>The atmosphere of Earth</h3>
            <br>
            Earth is surrounded by a relatively thin atmosphere (commonly called air) consisting of a mixture of gases,
            primarily molecular nitrogen (78 percent) and molecular oxygen (21 percent). Also present are much smaller
            amounts of gases such as argon (nearly 1 percent), water vapour (averaging 1 percent but highly variable in
            time and location), carbon dioxide (0.0395 percent [395 parts per million] and presently rising), methane
            (0.00018 percent [1.8 parts per million] and presently rising), and others, along with minute solid and
            liquid particles in suspension.
            <br>
            Because Earth has a weak gravitational field (by virtue of its size) and warm atmospheric temperatures (due
            to its proximity to the Sun) compared with the giant planets, it lacks the most common gases in the universe
            that they possess: hydrogen and helium. Whereas both the Sun and Jupiter are composed predominantly of these
            two elements, they could not be retained long on early Earth and rapidly evaporated into interplanetary
            space. The high oxygen content of Earth‚Äôs atmosphere is out of the ordinary. Oxygen is a highly reactive gas
            that, under most planetary conditions, would be combined with other chemicals in the atmosphere, surface,
            and crust. It is in fact supplied continuously by biological processes; without life, there would be
            virtually no free oxygen. The 1.8 parts per million of methane in the atmosphere is also far out of chemical
            equilibrium with the atmosphere and crust: it, too, is of biological origin, with the contribution by human
            activities far outweighing others.
            <br>
            The gases of the atmosphere extend from the surface of Earth to heights of thousands of kilometres,
            eventually merging with the solar wind‚Äîa stream of charged particles that flows outward from the outermost
            regions of the Sun. The composition of the atmosphere is more or less constant with height to an altitude of
            about 100 km (60 miles), with particular exceptions being water vapour and ozone.
            <br>
            The atmosphere is commonly described in terms of distinct layers, or regions. Most of the atmosphere is
            concentrated in the troposphere, which extends from the surface to an altitude of about 10‚Äì15 km (6‚Äì9
            miles), depending on latitude and season. The behaviour of the gases in this layer is controlled by
            convection. This process involves the turbulent, overturning motions resulting from buoyancy of near-surface
            air that is warmed by the Sun. Convection maintains a decreasing vertical temperature gradient‚Äîi.e., a
            temperature decline with altitude‚Äîof roughly 6 ¬∞C (10.8 ¬∞F) per km through the troposphere. At the top of
            the troposphere, which is called the tropopause, temperatures have fallen to about ‚àí80 ¬∞C (‚àí112 ¬∞F). The
            troposphere is the region where nearly all water vapour exists and essentially all weather occurs.
            <br>
            The dry, tenuous stratosphere lies above the troposphere and extends to an altitude of about 50 km (30
            miles). Convective motions are weak or absent in the stratosphere; motions instead tend to be horizontally
            oriented. The temperature in this layer increases with altitude.
            <br>
            In the upper stratospheric regions, absorption of ultraviolet light from the Sun breaks down molecular
            oxygen (O2); recombination of single oxygen atoms with O2 molecules into ozone (O3) creates the shielding
            ozone layer.
            <br>
            Above the relatively warm stratopause is the even more tenuous mesosphere, in which temperatures again
            decline with altitude to 80‚Äì90 km (50‚Äì56 miles) above the surface, where the mesopause is defined. The
            minimum temperature attained there is extremely variable with season. Temperatures then rise with increasing
            height through the overlying layer known as the thermosphere. Also above about 80‚Äì90 km there is an
            increasing fraction of charged, or ionized, particles, which from this altitude upward defines the
            ionosphere. Spectacular visible auroras are generated in this region, particularly along approximately
            circular zones around the poles, by the interaction of nitrogen and oxygen atoms in the atmosphere with
            episodic bursts of energetic particles originating from the Sun.
            <br>
            Earth‚Äôs general atmospheric circulation is driven by the energy of sunlight, which is more abundant in
            equatorial latitudes. Movement of this heat toward the poles is strongly affected by Earth‚Äôs rapid rotation
            and the associated Coriolis force at latitudes away from the Equator (which adds an east-west component to
            the direction of the winds), resulting in multiple cells of circulating air in each hemisphere.
            Instabilities (perturbations in the atmospheric flow that grow with time) produce the characteristic
            high-pressure areas and low-pressure storms of the midlatitudes as well as the fast, eastward-moving jet
            streams of the upper troposphere that guide the paths of storms. The oceans are massive reservoirs of heat
            that act largely to smooth out variations in Earth‚Äôs global temperatures, but their slowly changing currents
            and temperatures also influence weather and climate, as in the El Ni√±o/Southern Oscillation weather
            phenomenon (see climate: Circulation, currents, and ocean-atmosphere interaction; climate: El Ni√±o/Southern
            Oscillation and climatic change).
            <br>
            Earth‚Äôs atmosphere is not a static feature of the environment. Rather, its composition has evolved over
            geologic time in concert with life and is changing more rapidly today in response to human activities.
            Roughly halfway through the history of Earth, the atmosphere‚Äôs unusually high abundance of free oxygen began
            to develop, through photosynthesis by cyanobacteria (see blue-green algae) and saturation of natural surface
            sinks of oxygen (e.g., relatively oxygen-poor minerals and hydrogen-rich gases exuded from volcanoes).
            Accumulation of oxygen made it possible for complex cells, which consume oxygen during metabolism and of
            which all plants and animals are composed, to develop (see eukaryote).
            <br>
            Earth‚Äôs climate at any location varies with the seasons, but there are also longer-term variations in global
            climate. Volcanic explosions, such as the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines, can inject
            great quantities of dust particles into the stratosphere, which remain suspended for years, decreasing
            atmospheric transparency and resulting in measurable cooling worldwide. Much rarer, giant impacts of
            asteroids and comets can produce even more profound effects, including severe reductions in sunlight for
            months or years, such as many scientists believe led to the mass extinction of living species at the end of
            the Cretaceous Period, 66 million years ago. (For additional information on the risks posed by cosmic
            impacts and the chances of their occurrence, see Earth impact hazard.) The dominant climate variations
            observed in the recent geologic record are the ice ages, which are linked to variations in Earth‚Äôs tilt and
            its orbital geometry with respect to the Sun.
            <br>
            The physics of hydrogen fusion leads astronomers to conclude that the Sun was 30 percent less luminous
            during the earliest history of Earth than it is today. Hence, all else being equal, the oceans should have
            been frozen. Observations of Earth‚Äôs planetary neighbours, Mars and Venus, and estimates of the carbon
            locked in Earth‚Äôs crust at present suggest that there was much more carbon dioxide in Earth‚Äôs atmosphere
            during earlier periods. This would have enhanced warming of the surface via the greenhouse effect and so
            allowed the oceans to remain liquid.
            <br>
            Today there is 100,000 times more carbon dioxide buried in carbonate rocks in Earth‚Äôs crust than in the
            atmosphere, in sharp contrast to Venus, whose atmospheric evolution followed a different course. On Earth,
            the formation of carbonate shells by marine life is the principal mechanism for transforming carbon dioxide
            to carbonates; abiotic processes involving liquid water also produce carbonates, albeit more slowly. On
            Venus, however, life never had the chance to arise and to generate carbonates. Because of the planet‚Äôs
            location in the solar system, early Venus received 10‚Äì20 percent more sunlight than falls on Earth even
            today, despite the fainter young Sun at the time. Most planetary scientists believe that the elevated
            surface temperature that resulted kept water from condensing to a liquid. Instead, it remained in the
            atmosphere as water vapour, which, like carbon dioxide, is an efficient greenhouse gas. Together the two
            gases caused surface temperatures to rise even higher so that massive amounts of water escaped to the
            stratosphere, where it was dissociated by solar ultraviolet radiation. With conditions now too hot and dry
            to permit abiotic carbonate formation, most or all of the planet‚Äôs inventory of carbon remained in the
            atmosphere as carbon dioxide. Models predict that Earth may suffer the same fate in a billion years, when
            the Sun exceeds its present brightness by 10‚Äì20 percent.
            <br>
            Between the late 1950s and the end of the 20th century, the amount of carbon dioxide in Earth‚Äôs atmosphere
            increased by more than 15 percent because of the burning of fossil fuels (e.g., coal, oil, and natural gas)
            and the destruction of tropical rainforests, such as that of the Amazon River basin. Computer models predict
            that a net doubling of carbon dioxide by the middle of the 21st century could lead to a global warming of
            1.5‚Äì4.5 ¬∞C (2.7‚Äì8.1 ¬∞F) averaged over the planet, which would have profound effects on sea level and
            agriculture. Although this conclusion has been criticized by some on the basis that the warming observed so
            far has not kept pace with the projection, analyses of ocean temperature data have suggested that much of
            the warming during the 20th century actually occurred in the oceans themselves‚Äîand will eventually appear in
            the atmosphere.
            <br>
            Another present concern regarding the atmosphere is the impact of human activities on the stratospheric
            ozone layer. Complex chemical reactions involving traces of man-made chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) were found
            in the mid-1980s to be creating temporary holes in the ozone layer, particularly over Antarctica, during
            polar spring. Yet more disturbing was the discovery of a growing depletion of ozone over the highly
            populated temperate latitudes, since the short-wavelength ultraviolet radiation that the ozone layer
            effectively absorbs has been found to cause skin cancer. International agreements in place to halt the
            production of the most egregious ozone-destroying CFCs will eventually halt and reverse the depletion, but
            only by the middle of the 21st century, because of the long residence time of these chemicals in the
            stratosphere.

            <h3>The Hydrosphere</h3>
            <br>
            Earth‚Äôs hydrosphere is a discontinuous layer of water at or near the planet‚Äôs surface; it includes all
            liquid and frozen surface waters, groundwater held in soil and rock, and atmospheric water vapour. Unique
            within the solar system, the hydrosphere is essential to all life as it is presently understood. Earth has a
            surface area of roughly 510,066,000 square km (196,938,000 square miles); almost 71 percent of Earth‚Äôs
            surface is covered by saltwater oceans. The total volume of liquid water on Earth is about 1.39 billion
            cubic km (332.5 million cubic miles), and it has an average temperature of about 4 ¬∞C (39.2 ¬∞F), not far
            above the freezing point of water. The oceans contain about 97 percent of the planet‚Äôs water volume. The
            remainder occurs as fresh water, three-quarters of which is locked up in the form of ice at polar latitudes.
            Most of the remaining fresh water is groundwater held in soils and rocks; less than 1 percent of it occurs
            in lakes and rivers. In terms of percentage, atmospheric water vapour is negligible, but the transport of
            water evaporated from the oceans onto land surfaces is an integral part of the hydrologic cycle that renews
            and sustains life.
            <br>
            The hydrologic cycle involves the transfer of water from the oceans through the atmosphere to the continents
            and back to the oceans over and beneath the land surface. The cycle includes processes such as
            precipitation, evaporation, transpiration, infiltration, percolation, and runoff. These processes operate
            throughout the entire hydrosphere, which extends from about 15 km (9 miles) into the atmosphere to roughly 5
            km (3 miles) into the crust.
            <br>
            About one-third of the solar energy that reaches Earth‚Äôs surface is expended on evaporating ocean water. The
            resulting atmospheric moisture and humidity condense into clouds, rain, snow, and dew. Moisture is a crucial
            factor in determining weather. It is the driving force behind storms and is responsible for separating
            electrical charge, which is the cause of lightning and thus of natural wildland fires, which have an
            important role in some ecosystems. Moisture wets the land, replenishes subterranean aquifers, chemically
            weathers the rocks, erodes the landscape, nourishes life, and fills the rivers, which carry dissolved
            chemicals and sediments back into the oceans.
            <br>
            Water also plays a vital role in the carbon dioxide cycle (a part of the more inclusive carbon cycle). Under
            the action of water and dissolved carbon dioxide, calcium is weathered from continental rocks and carried to
            the oceans, where it combines to form calcium carbonates (including shells of marine life). Eventually the
            carbonates are deposited on the seafloor and are lithified to form limestones. Some of these carbonate rocks
            are later dragged deep into Earth‚Äôs interior by the global process of plate tectonics (see below The outer
            shell) and melted, resulting in a rerelease of carbon dioxide (from volcanoes, for example) into the
            atmosphere. Cyclic processing of water, carbon dioxide, and oxygen through geologic and biological systems
            on Earth has been fundamental to maintaining the habitability of the planet with time and to shaping the
            erosion and weathering of the continents, and it contrasts sharply with the lack of such processes on Venus.
            (Evidence of past episodes of liquid water erosion‚Äîand possibly limited amounts of such erosion today‚Äîhas
            been found on Mars.)

            <br><br>
            Earth‚Äôs outermost, rigid, rocky layer is called the crust. It is composed of low-density, easily melted
            rocks; the continental crust is predominantly granitic rock (see granite), while composition of the oceanic
            crust corresponds mainly to that of basalt and gabbro. Analyses of seismic waves, generated by earthquakes
            within Earth‚Äôs interior, show that the crust extends about 50 km (30 miles) beneath the continents but only
            5‚Äì10 km (3‚Äì6 miles) beneath the ocean floors.
